    &lt;p&gt;groups:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;- the doctor, the specialist, the experts who know all about the disease&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;- the patient, the experts who know all about the effects of the disease&lt;/p&gt;

His area of interest is the built environment; in particular, research into how to make the built environment age-friendly through enhanced accessibility forms the core of his research expertise. He currently represents the University of Central Lancashire as an expert researcher on an EU-funded Project, OIKONET, a global multidisciplinary network on housing research and learning (&lt;a href="http://arcdev.housing.salle.url.edu/oikonet/index.php/admin_controller/partners"&gt;http://arcdev.housing.salle.url.edu/oikonet/index.php/admin_controller/partners&lt;/a&gt;). One of the expected outputs of this project is to develop modern housing solutions in Europe through the collaboration of three work packages, namely research, pedagogy and community participation. The University of Central Lancashire, is leading the research work package, working with 34 partners across Europe, Russia, and South America. Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s role is to provide evidence-based research input, in order to facilitate collaboration among the partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p style="margin-left:-14.2pt"&gt;Furthermore, Durosaiye is in the final year of his PhD research study, as of 2015, which is examining how the design, management and use of the workplace influence older nurses&amp;rsquo; health and wellbeing and their work ability in the built environment. This PhD research project is being conducted under the auspices of the National Health Service (NHS) in England, and is fully funded and supported by the University of Central Lancashire, UK. This study is expected to establish the environmental characteristics of an age-friendly workplace by identifying workplace design factors that affect the safety, health, comfort and productivity of older nurses in the built environment within the NHS. The main output of this research study is to develop a design framework that can serve as a guideline to create a fit between older nurses and the work environment within the NHS in England. The findings of this research study and the design framework that is being developed will inform policy makers and contribute immensely to the existing body of knowledge of age-friendly workplace within the NHS in England.&lt;/p&gt;

He has 23 years&amp;rsquo; research experience in cardiovascular disease working in laboratories in London, Cambridge and Oxford, Where his interests focused predominantly on atherosclerosis, with studies ranging from pathology, through molecular and cellular biology to molecular genetics. In 1997, he was recruited by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals from a Senior Fellowship Position leading his own molecular genetics group in Oxford, to lead the exploration of new therapeutic approaches in atherosclerosis, specifically focusing on is research interests in vascular biology. Following the merger with Astra, Dr Henney moved within the newly formed company, AstraZeneca, to a position of Global Programme Manager Responsible for prototyping strategic improvements to the company&amp;rsquo;s approaches to pharmaceutical target identification, and the reduction of attrition in early development. This involved directing activities both across research sites and across functional project teams in the US, Sweden and the UK. The work undertaken in this Programme resulted in the creation of an entirely new multidisciplinary department that focused on pathway mapping, modelling and simulation. With personnel based in the UK and US, and global project interactions across all therapy areas, the work of this department supported drug projects across Research and Development. Under his leadership, the department evolved to establish the practice of Systems Biology that, together with strong relationships with key academic centres and biotechs, prototyped the application of mechanistic disease modelling approaches to the discovery and development of innovative medicines. Since leaving AstraZeneca in 2009, Dr Henney has continued his interest in Systems Biology through his company, Obsidian Biomedical Consulting Ltd., helping academics to work more closely with industry. In April 2010, Dr Henney was invited to direct a new German national flagship research programme in Systems Biology: The Virtual Liver Network, which is his current major focus&lt;/p&gt;

    Prior to my retirement in the beginning of 2008 I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as international sales manager in industry.&lt;br /&gt;
    I&amp;rsquo;ve studied law and at a later state web based vocational education for business people.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    In 2004 I was diagnosed with Attenuated Familial Polyposis (aFAP) of my proximal colon out of clinical sight, which was however not supported by human genetical findings.&lt;br /&gt;
    In the beginning of 2009 I was diagnosed with a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; stage metastatic colon cancer which took its origin from a hyperplastic adenoma in my caecum and which had grown within 9 months after my previous colonosciopy.&lt;br /&gt;
    Consequently my entire colon was removed and I&amp;rsquo;m now living with a ileorectal anastomosis. The subsequent&amp;nbsp; chemo therapy was successful at fighting back my hepatic metastases and kept me alive up to now.&lt;br /&gt;
    In June this year I had a surgical operation for the replacement of my right hip link by a endo prostesis. I had been painfully waiting for the operation over two years, until my oncoloist saw a chance to allow for pausing my chemo therapy since an operation of such extend was by no means advisable under running chemo therapy. This was my second operation of this kind since my left hip link was replaced already in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
    Another health problem is originating from my younger days when at the age of 30 I was operated from a lumbar subdural tumor. The operation prevented me from sitting in a wheel chair however I was never without problems with my back and my legs. Since 20 years I&amp;rsquo;m suffering from spinal stenosis which in consequence is limiting my walking range.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    Since 2004 I&amp;rsquo;m actively engaged in patient support groups. This helped me considerably to cope with my cancer diagnosis and my life afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    I&amp;rsquo;m working now in leading positions of different patient advocacy organisations which are:&lt;br /&gt;
    President of EuropaColon Germany&lt;br /&gt;
    Vice President of Familienhilfe Darmkrebs (Family support with hereditary CRC)&lt;br /&gt;
    Board member and Director for Germany and Europe of Lynch Syndrome International (LSI)&lt;br /&gt;
    Member of the Patient Advisory Board of the Centre for Rare Diseases at the University Clinics of Bonn&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    As such I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in numerous conferences and workshops on both national and international level and I would be glad to becoming invited to the European Health Forum since I&amp;rsquo;m confident that this could result in a mutual benefit.&lt;br /&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Bernard P&amp;eacute;coul has led the Drugs for Neglected Diseases&amp;nbsp;initiative&amp;nbsp;(DNDi) since its foundation in 2003. Under his guidance, DNDi&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a not-for-profit research and development organization &amp;ndash; with hundreds of public and private partners, has delivered six new treatments for the most neglected diseases (leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease) and for malaria. It has developed a robust portfolio of projects spanning from discovery to implementation for these diseases as well as filaria, paediatric HIV, mycetoma, and hepatits C. As part of DNDi&amp;rsquo;s dynamic portfolio approach, &amp;uml;Dr P&amp;eacute;coul is also leading the incubation of a product development partnership to address R&amp;amp;D for new antibiotic treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;DNDi&amp;nbsp;aims to deliver a total of 16 to 18 new treatments for neglected patients by 2023, with a total of EUR 650 million, spanning 10 disease areas. The initiative, through its R&amp;amp;D work, also builds capacity in disease endemic countries through research platforms and technology transfers and advocates for greater public leadership to sustainably address the health needs of neglected patients.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Prior to DNDi, Dr P&amp;eacute;coul was Director of the M&amp;eacute;decins Sans Fronti&amp;egrave;res (MSF) Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines from 1998 to 2003, a position he took on after that of Executive Director of MSF-France. While working with MSF, Dr P&amp;eacute;coul carried out field missions in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. In 1988, he co-founded Epicentre, an MSF-affiliated NGO specialized in epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After obtaining his medical degree at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, France, Dr P&amp;eacute;coul earned a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in public health at Tulane University, USA. In 2012, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree by the University of Dundee, UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Over the last 4-5 years, various telemedicine solutions have moved from pilot to daily practise. The solutions have primarily focused on improving the cooperation between the hospital, the primary care sector and the patients. Examples of solutions deployed are home-hospitalisation of COPD patients; videoconference-based language interpretation and a shared care system for diabetic foot ulcer patients between homecare and hospital experts. Many of the solutions have been developed in EU projects and are currently being evaluated at large scale and in RCTs as part of the EU projects RENEWING HEALTH.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Claus&amp;#39; work with eHealth in the hospital has led to OUH being an international frontrunner in clinical innovation and telemedicine, and has ensured a HIMSS Stage 6 recognition for OUH.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Claus was Project Manager of the MethoTelemed project that developed the MAST evaluation model for telemedicine solutions, which is now being employed across Europe as the common evaluation model for mature telehealth solutions to provide decision support to executives in the health sector and at EU level.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Previously Claus worked in MedCom - the national Danish organisation for implementation of electronic communication in the health and social care sector. From 2000 to 2003 he was in charge of establishing the national Danish IP-based healthcare network.

His 35 years of research has focussed on the need to improve the information people get about their medicines. Theo&amp;rsquo;s research has critically examined the impact of European legislation on mandatory patient leaflets, and how they are tested with the public &amp;ndash; so called &amp;lsquo;user testing&amp;rsquo;. This led to the formation of a spin-out company Luto Research &lt;a href="http://www.luto.co.uk"&gt;www.luto.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; which has become a leading and influential provider of user testing services in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The synergies between the University and Luto have been the foundation of his recent internationally influential work, notably how best to present benefit and harm information to patients about medicines. Theo believes an understanding of both is a pre-requisite for patients being truly &amp;rsquo;informed&amp;rsquo; about their medicines. In a BMJ editorial, he controversially promoted his view that an informed patient should be a goal in itself &amp;ndash; if they then decide that a medicine is not right for them, this is an appropriate and acceptable outcome; &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;an informed patient is not necessarily an obedient patient&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Theo Raynor has advised the UK Commission on Human Medicines, the European Medicines Agency, the European Parliament, and the US Food and Drugs Administration. He has delivered invited plenaries across the world, including the Centennial World Pharmacy Congress. He appears frequently in the press, radio and television, speaking about the need for better consumer medicines information. He was the recipient in 2014 of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.&lt;/p&gt;
