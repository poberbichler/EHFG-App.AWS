At the same time cities represent a unique access point for identifying multi-stakeholder solutions to the societal challenges presented by these diseases.</p> \n<p>We intend to examine the following specific areas within the context of the city environment and the different roles of multiple actors in NCD responses:<br> - how to promote health literacy;<br> - how to reduce the impact of the marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children;<br> - how to produce and promote more food products consistent with a healthy diet;<br> - how to promote and create an enabling environment for healthy behaviours among workers and<br> - how to reduce inequity in the prevention and control of NCDs.</p> \n<p>We will also analyse examples of how cities can serve as the perfect microcosm for bringing together the local government, private sector, NGOs and academia for population-based NCD responses.</p> \n<p>Welcome by<br> <span style=\"color:#1272d6\">Zsuzsanna Jakab, Regional Director, WHO Regional Office for Europe<br> Helmut Brand, President, International Forum Gastein</span><br> <br> <span style=\"color:#1272d6\">Bente Mikkelsen, Head a.i. of the Secretariat, WHO Global Coordination Mechanism on the Prevention and Control of NCDs (WHO GCM/NCD)<br> Yvonne Doyle, Regional Director, Public Health England<br> Mariana Dyakova, Consultant in Public Health, Policy, Research and International Development, Public Health Wales<br> Karolina Mackiewicz, Development Manager, Baltic Region Healthy Cities Association, WHO Collaborating Centre for Healthy Cities and Urban Health in the Baltic Region<br> Pamela Rendi-Wagner, Director, Federal Ministry of Health and Women's Affairs, Austria<br> Alexey Kulikov, World Health Organization</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color:#1272d6\">Chaired by Oleg Chestnov, Assistant Director-General, World Health Organization Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health Program</span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"color:#A9A9A9\">(last updated: 28.09.2016 md)</span></p>",

There are compelling arguments for early intervention in many areas of public health, from promoting early childhood development to more controversial issues such as the role and regulation of endocrine disrupters.

A manager thinks about cutbacks or money relocation. An insurer introduces treatment criteria. A surgeon would probably be thinking that he wants to operate as soon as possible. The point we want to make is that you and I, as persons, are barely included in the interactive process of developing a flourishing, cost-cutting health care system.</p> \n<p>The 19th European Health Forum Gastein is entitled “Demographics and Diversity in Europe - New Solutions for Health”. Citizens experience demographic changes. Citizens are diverse. Diversity has shaped Europe. Citizens are increasingly seeking medical care across borders.</p> \n<p>In this demographically altered Europe, it is increasingly a question of finance. Costs. But in order to realise cost economies, a “successful interaction between patient and professional” is an absolute necessity. “Patients are vulnerable. As are professionals, who have to cope with their own implicit vulnerability. Or strength. Or something that goes beyond strong and weak.”</p> \n<p>Please join us for breakfast workshop.<br> We want to show you how EPECS is gathering the experiences of patients and citizens about cross-border health care.

Remarkably, demography seems to be causing trouble on two fronts. The conventional problem is that of supporting social insurance for the elderly with a declining base of working-age adults, and that problem hasn't gone away.

Respondents to the mentioned consultation considered that having users' consent as well as strong privacy and security tools in place is a crucial issue in relation to mobile health apps. Therefore, the European Commission encouraged setting up a code of conduct on mobile health apps, covering privacy principles, in order to increase trust. Work on the Code of Conduct started in April of 2015, when a drafting team of industry members was set up with the objective of developing the text of the code. The Code provides practical guidance for app developers on data protection principles that need to be taken into account in the development of mHealth apps. App developers respecting the rules of this code will be able to sign it and their apps will be included in a publicly available register. The Code has been drafted with the vision to ensure it to be easily understandable also for those who may not have access to legal expertise. The core of the Code of Conduct consists of practical guidelines for app developers. Once applied in practice, this Code will provide a competitive advantage for those who are signatory to it and help to promote trust among users of mHealth apps. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/code-conduct-privacy-mhealth-apps-has-been-finalised', '_blank')\">Further reading</a>.</p> \n<p><span style=\"color:#1272d6\">Alexander Whalen, Manager of the Digital Economy Policy Group, Digitaleurope<br> Hans Graux, Founding Partner, time.lex</span><br> </p> \n<p><strong>Part 2 | Guidelines on reliability and validity of mHealth apps' data – presentation of the document and discussion</strong><br> In February 2016 the European Commission set up a working group to develop guidelines for assessing data validity and reliability of mHealth apps. The guidelines are expected to be drafted by the end of 2016. The first draft was presented and discussed at an open stakeholder meeting on 4 May 2016. The second draft was made public at the end of May for open consultation with stakeholders. The working group has started working on the next iteration of the draft which is expected by mid-October and will be followed by another round of comments.<br> The discussions have been focussing on the main target groups, purpose and scope of the guidelines, and on the assessment domains. Feedback from the first round of consultations revealed that further work is needed, in particular on clarifying the scope and purpose of the guidelines, to define the areas where the guidelines can add most value, taking into account the existing legislative framework as well as other related initiatives, for example in the field of standardisation. On the methodological approach the need for a risk categorisation of health apps still needs in depth discussions, as well as the recommended methodologies and tools for assessing validity and reliability of health apps and extending the scope to other aspects such as usability, functionality, efficacy etc. For the next iteration, the working group will also have a close look at the targeting of the guidelines - how to make these useful and usable for different target groups and what the needs of different groups are.<br> The recent draft document can be found <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/current-initiatives-unlock-potential-mobile-health-europe', '_blank')\">here</a>.<br> <br> <span style=\"color:#1272d6\">Julie Bretland - Director/Founder, Our Mobile Health Ltd., UK<br> Pierre Trudelle, Project Manager, Department of Care Coordination, Appropriatness and Quality of Care, National Authority for Health (HAS), France</span></p> \n<p>Moderated by <span style=\"color:#1272d6\">Terje Peetso, Policy Officer, DG CONNECT, European Commission</span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"color:#A9A9A9\">(last updated: 05.09.2016 md)</span></p>",

Death rates from PC are rising across Europe while those from all other cancers continue to fall. It is predicted that in 2030 PC will be the second most frequent cancer. There is no option to control PC incidence/mortality by primary or secondary (screening) prevention and only minor advances have been done recently in tertiary prevention under the umbrella of personalised treatment.<br> COST Actions are intergovernmental capacity building frameworks for European Cooperation in Science and Technology connecting scientists throughout Europe and worldwide and by this maximizing the impact of research on policy makers, regulatory bodies, national decision makers and the private sector.<br> Key stakeholders from administration, academia, NGOs and industry will discuss how a European coordinated approach to combat PC via this ongoing COST Action „EUPancreas\" can act as a role model for Europe. Experiences from the Action highly contribute to improving the management of rare diseases in European Reference Centers (ERCs). Furthermore, the EC identified PC as a tracer in bridging ”rare” und “common diseases”.</p> \n<p><br> <span style=\"color:#1272d6\">NURIA MALATS, CNIO Madrid, Spain<br> RICARDO BAPTISTA LEITE, Member of Parliament, Portugal<br> MATTHIAS REUMANN, IBM Research<br> LADA LEYENS, Swissmedic, Switzerland<br> ANGELA BRAND, EUPAncreas WG4 Coordinator, Maastricht University</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color:#1272d6\">Chaired by ELKE ANKLAM, Director, DG Joint Research Centre, European Commission</span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"color:#A9A9A9\">(last updated 21.09 2016 md)</span></p>",
