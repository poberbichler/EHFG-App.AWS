    "description": "Digital tools hold the potential to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and quality of care. But even if the technologies are at hand, we cannot fully utilise them whilst the digital skills gap in the health workforce remains.During the COVID-19 pandemic many digital health tools moved from being viewed as a potential opportunity to becoming an immediate necessity, and the use of them increased substantially, including tools for eHealth, mHealth, and Big Data.The European Commission, being mindful of progress in other regions of the world, has launched a skills agenda for a green and digital transformation for all economic sectors to ensure necessary modernisation. For health and social care, a digitally skilled health workforce is absolutely essential to ensure patient centeredness, care integration and multi-disciplinary teamwork. Given that the European health workforce is mobile, crossing national borders, digital skills must be ensured in all countries.Now is the time to strengthen digital skills as many countries are building back better their health systems. But what’s the EU’s role in closing the digital skills gap with regards to regulation, funding, quality standards, and technical issues? And how can we support Member States to collaborate more effectively in bridging the digital divide amongst the health workforce in order to universally improve care?",

From the challenge of providing immediate medical aid to the people injured by the hostilities to ensuring continuity of care for chronic patients; from containing the spread of infectious diseases to ensuring access to healthcare for displaced people – the devastating impact of war on healthcare systems is dramatic.The aim of this webinar is to consider the current health-related issues caused by the conflict in Ukraine, through the lens of those who have experienced armed conflict in the recent past – communities in the Balkans. The webinar aims to bring together local actors from the health sector, civil society and policymakers involved in providing medical assistance during the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, as well as working for the reconstruction of the local healthcare systems in the post-war phase, with EU policymakers and international actors who are dealing with the response to the Ukrainian conflict now.Read the webinar outcomes here. ",

    "description": "European Reference Networks (ERNs) aim to optimise care for patients with complex or rare diseases and conditions that require highly specialised treatment, by facilitating discussion among providers in different European countries and bundling knowledge and resources. The first ERNs were launched in 2017, involving more than 900 highly specialised healthcare units from over 300 hospitals in 26 EU countries.The first years of experience have shown that ERNs have succeeded in strengthening cross-border collaboration, involving patients in their activities and pooling expert knowledge. At the same time, more could be done to increase disease coverage, reduce administrative burden and the uneven representation of participating countries, plus to secure sufficient funding and integration in national healthcare systems.The EU4Health programme reiterates a strong, shared commitment to addressing chronic diseases, including the potential to extend the scope of ERNs to other complex communicable and non-communicable diseases. How can we build on the successes of the ERN model to ensure best possible care for patients with rare diseases in a post-pandemic world? Is the ERN model the way forward for service delivery in a stronger European Health Union?This is the third installment in a series of webinars on the European Health Union initiative, aiming at advancing the European Health Union beyond crisis preparedness and adding value for societies and citizens.

As we embark on the journey towards a true European Health Union, it is essential to recognise the importance of the health workforce by placing their mental health first rather than last, addressing both root causes and consequences. What bold actions are needed to make progress possible? This session draws on the perspectives of young professionals and calls for a new culture both within the health workforce but also within the community to tackle mental health. We will discuss how proper European-level action and local supporting mechanisms can be enforced towards a healthier health workforce, demonstrating solidarity as a core principle of a true European Health Union. ",

In fact recently published data just from the WHO European Region revealed that 17 million individuals experienced ongoing COVID-19 symptoms for at least three months during the first two years of the pandemic. This phenomenon, known as “Long COVID”, or \"Post COVID-19 Condition\", has been associated with a range of overlapping symptoms from fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain, to muscle aches and cognitive dysfunction. The impact on the daily lives of sufferers can be immense - on their mental health, social life and their ability to perform their jobs. While it took considerable time for Long COVID to receive the attention it deserves, there lately seems to be momentum for more concrete action to minimise the economic, social and health consequences of this debilitating condition.This \"fireside chat\" session will explore patient experiences of Long COVID, hear how different countries are handling and treating the condition, and give an insight into activities at the European level to raise awareness of Long COVID and drive forward research, treatment and rehabilitation services.",

    "description": "Our increasingly globalised, commodified and centralised food systems have an enormous impact on health, environmental conditions, and social equity and rights in Europe and the rest of the world. The urgency for a transition to sustainable – and health-promoting food systems is self-evident. There’s been substantial support and constructive engagement with the EU Farm to Fork Strategy’s agenda recently. However, a lot of work is still ahead in realising our joint commitment to sustainability, accompanied by a paradigm shift towards a public health-oriented food system.The nature of our food systems affects what and how people consume, and conversely, people, by the choices they make and what they consume, can have a big impact on shaping these systems. This session will explore the role of (informed, empowered and literate) citizens in multi-governance efforts to transition to safer, healthier, more sustainable and equitable food systems. This will be done by showcasing three examples of evidence-based policies and initiatives where consumers and citizens play a key role for this purpose.",

A pandemic had been on the cards for a while, with experts warning one was “overdue”, although no-one predicted the sheer global scale or impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.Other events have escalated beyond imagination – such as Russia´s invasion of Ukraine. With paradigms shaken, lives upended and a geopolitical realignment threatening the international rules-based order as we know it, this plenary will reflect on the complex challenges faced by Europe, how they will impact and reshape the European Union, and what they mean for the future of health and well-being across the continent.",

The European Health Union must strive for equity in access and quality of care no matter where patients live, creating a level playing field across the bloc.Building upon the EU Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015), this session will explore what needs to be done, and by whom, to facilitate equity, efficiency, quality, and safety for all patients so nobody is left behind. An EU-wide data framework, patient literacy, national policies, and clinical practice guidelines can help ensure a successful transplantation journey.Our speakers encompass patients, clinicians, data experts, national officials, and EU policymakers.

Reasons range from the growing health and long-term care demands of an ageing population to costly technological progress in medical services and the impact of pandemics. To cope with rising health expenditures, the availability of funding is key to ensuring sustainable, innovative, and resilient health systems. It is therefore crucial to demonstrate the financial sustainability of investments in health and the concomitant benefits to all stakeholders. This session will examine existing and potential future funding mechanisms and other innovative solutions contributing to make health systems more sustainable, environmentally friendlier, and efficient while delivering high quality care.

In the long term, an EoW aims at strengthening equity, societal resilience and environmental sustainability. The COVID-19 experience demonstrates how crucial an EoW can be to the short- and medium-term fiscal sustainability and societal stability.While not being an entirely new model, the EoW is a policy change-maker and has far-reaching economic, social and political implications. Investing in people´s health and wellbeing has wider co-benefits for other sectors, including economic growth and environmental sustainability, while not doing so generates wider societal co-costs.This session highlights the real-world significance and experiences of piloting, scaling-up and implementing the EoW - in the EU and beyond.",

One in five deaths worldwide is caused by sepsis. Low awareness rates make it difficult for patients and clinicians to detect sepsis symptoms in time and respond adequately. However, sepsis can be easily treated. Early recognition and cost-effective tools can save lives and minimise the socio-economic burden on health systems. Yet, still today, too many sepsis patients die or suffer long-term consequences from wrong diagnoses and therapies. In this session, we will learn about sepsis from the patient perspective, share new data on the quality of sepsis care, and discuss its importance in infection management and AMR strategies. We will present sepsis as an indicator of the quality of care, explore best practices in sepsis management, and discuss how harmonised approaches at the EU level could save lives across Europe. ",

Existing efforts to prevent NCDs are clearly not sufficient to weather the socio-economic storm caused by ageing populations and lowering fertility rate. Societies shall face economic and resource challenges in the prevention of inequitable healthcare. The most effective solution to ensure sustainable and fair healthcare systems is to shift their design to keeping people healthier for longer, and to prevent the preventable. Enter predictive genomics. What is predictive genomics, and can it innovate prevention? What are the risks? Four experts will debate these questions and more in a fast-paced debate where the audience participants will have their say on the future of predictive genomics. ",

The concept of One Health recognises the interplay of the four spheres of people, plants, animals and their environment in shaping health and well-being, and offers a paradigm for addressing the interconnected threats.Yet One Health thinking has been around for over 20 years and implementing such a concept has to date remained relatively elusive. This plenary will consider the hurdles already experienced in attempting to operationalise this concept and explore how we can overcome them.What does a One Health approach mean in practice for different stakeholders? Do recent initiatives combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic offer a step-change to ensure that this time round a One Health approach can finally be put into practice to tackle health threats and build a healthier, more equitable and sustainable future for all?

Debilitating inequalities of access to care are spiralling, which is a critical barrier to delivery of equitable care. Solving health inequalities in healthcare does not wholly lie with any one stakeholder. Sustainable success and solutions will only be delivered through clarity of goals, innovative and inclusive community-based programmes, conscious collaborations between the public and private sector, and accelerated, measured impact. The session will convene eminent experts to discuss barriers and benchmarks to support improved equitable access to healthcare for at-risk communities. Panellists will reflect on real-life learnings, including those from the COVID-19 pandemic, and debate what a potential 2030 roadmap to success looks like for the EU Member States. What are the building blocks policymakers and system funders need to have in place to be able to provide and facilitate the impact from a consortium of players? How can we incentivise collective and innovative thinking? What do we expect specifically from the pharmaceutical sector?We invite you to join this session, delivered by Porter Novelli Health, to explore how to best support goals to remove health inequalities across Europe through innovative policy design.",

But will they agree on how to achieve them? In this interactive session, participants are invited to experience the roles of those they sometimes challenge in policy debates: for example, payers will have the opportunity to play industry representatives, patients to play regulators and industry to play civil servants from ministries of health or finance. The goal: design the best pharmaceutical ecosystem for Europe moving forward. The difficulty: everyone wants to take different approaches and actions, but without concerted efforts towards collaboration, no one will win! Join us and walk a mile in someone else´s shoes! Due to its unique, interactive approach, this session will be for in-person participation only. ",

What are some significant sources of air pollution indoors? Should policy focus on regulating these sources or setting emission standards? While outdoor air quality has been regulated at the EU level for many years, indoor air quality remains largely outside the legislative framework despite people spending over 90% of their time indoors. However, the quality of the air people breathe when indoors has been brought to the forefront of the public conversation during the pandemic. It is therefore important to utilise this momentum and drive the conversation further to develop EU policies and regulations. This session will open the discussion for recommendations to tackle indoor air quality from a multidisciplinary, Health in All Policies perspective, as part of the drive to reimagine the built environment in a way that protects human and planetary health. ",

The EU was quick to rise to the occasion with tailored crisis preparedness and response measures as the first building blocks of a European Health Union. However, the crisis also led to the collective realisation that a focus on citizen wellbeing across all EU policymaking is possible and shows true promise.Since then multiple crises have significantly altered the European political environment. The climate crisis and resulting natural disasters and migratory challenges, the war in Ukraine and resulting energy and economic crises, risk of pandemics and more represent a challenge for prioritising health and wellbeing.In this context, the health community must ensure that health and wellbeing remain a priority for European policymakers. The 2024 European elections will be a milestone in this regard. If we are to ensure a resilient European Union in the face of ever-evolving global threats, the Commission must keep health as a priority ahead of the 2024 elections with a view to wellbeing becoming an integral objective of EU policymaking.In this session, participants will reflect on what needs to be done to reaffirm the relevance of health at the EU level against a backdrop of the ongoing global climate, economic and health crises. Join us to work towards a healthier and more prosperous society by ensuring that health & wellbeing remain a central theme of the 2024 European elections!",

Can a European Health Union better equip Europe to deal with these crises and address the complex interplay of forces behind them? The shocks experienced in recent years could serve as triggers to move towards concerted efforts to tackle the shared complex challenges that have come to the fore.We have been brutally reminded of the importance of peace for health, of looking out for the most vulnerable in our societies, of better supporting, training and equipping our frontline workers, and of the importance of making ambitious efforts to move global health forward on European political agendas. What does this vision of a moonshot for a Health Union involve, with what new fuel can the initiative be powered, and what actions need to be taken to guide the moonshot on the right trajectory before the window of opportunity for launch closes? Is a European Health Union the bold new approach needed to help restore the equity, solidarity and trust that of late has been repeatedly called into question?",
